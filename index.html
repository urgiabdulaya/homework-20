            <h2> Background</h2>

            <p>

                For my UX/UI bootcamp at the University of Minnesota, my classmates and I had to pick a nonprofit
                organization to create a Responsive Web Design. As we were looking for a nonprofit organization to
                redesign, my teammate suggested taking a look at CAIR-MN’s current website. As my teammates and I spent
                some time scrolling through CAIR-MN’s website, we noticed some problems surrounds a lack of
                accessibility, their website being unresponsive to other devices, an unresponsive user flow, and their
                website feeling disorganized. As we scrolled through the website, we were able to pinpoint exactly what
                needed to be fixed, but still had a hard time understand who CAIR-MN is and what their organization is
                all about.

                After sometime scrolling through their website, we were finally able to understand who CAIR-MN is and
                their mission. CAIR-MN’s mission is to enhance the understand of Islam, protect civil rights, promote
                justice, and empower American Muslims. As a Muslim American myself, this project was personal. I was
                able to resonate with each person I interviewed and was really motivated to create a masterpiece.

            <h2>
                User Interviews & Surveys
            </h2>
            <p>
                I decided to conduct user interviews, along with online surveys, as this topic is sensitive and
                people may not feel comfortable sharing their true experiences during a 1:1 interview. For my user
                interviews, I interviewed five different users who identifies as Muslim Americans, as well as reside
                in Minnesota. The user interviews consisted of questions surrounding the participants experiences as
                Muslim Americans and ways they may have coped upon their civil rights being violated. I recorded all
                the answers during the interview (with their permission), which later helped me analyze the users
                responses.

                Along with user interviews, users also participated in a online survey. I surveyed a total of 23
                participants are based in Minnesota, as well as identify as Muslim Americans. With the survey, I
                wanted to get a better understanding of who CAIR-MN users are and their experiences as a Muslim
                American. Since this is a sensitive and personal topic, I was able to get more participants through
                the survey than the user interviews. The survey consisted of questions surrounding who the users
                are, if they are familiar with CAIR-MN and if so, what CAIR-MN resources have they used, if users
                have experienced discrimination due to their religion, as well as where the discrimination took
                place.

        <spam class="text-center">Quantivite</spam>
        <p>
            The quantivite research consisted of an online survey of 11 questions, which were taken by 23 people
            and
            the following are the findings:

        <h2>Interview Insights </h2>
        <span class="text-center">Qualitative</span>
        <p>
            To get a better understanding of CAIR-MN users and their targeted audience, I first needed to get a
            better understanding of Muslim Americans and their struggles living in America as someone who practices
            a different religion than the typical person in the western culture. So I began my interview by asking
            participants questions, such as ‘What’s the hardest part about being a Muslim American?’ and ‘How do you
            currently go about seeking support when your rights are being violated?’ I then dug into their biggest
            pain points as a Muslim American and how it has impact areas of their lives.

        <h2>User Persona</h2>
        <p>Based off the interviews and survey collected, I went ahead and created a research based user persona. I
            referred back to it throughout the entire project. </p>

        <h6>Phase three: Ideate </h6>
        <h2>Card Sorting</h2>
        <p>I performed a closed card sorting exercise with a few of my potential users to get a clear understanding
            of how they would perceive the websites flow.

            Objective: Understand how users conceptualize and mentally associate certain categories
            Task: Users were shown a list of navigation headings and secondary navigation options that would be
            listed on the website. They were asked to categories the navigation headings with the secondary
            navigation option that they might associate together.

            points, and alternative paths.</p>

        <h2>Usability testing</h2>
        <p>Usability testing were done via zoom. I wrote a script and protocol for the testing process and asked
            users
            to perform certain task, identify clickable parts of the prototype and give their observations and
            feedback.

            During the usability testing, I avoided giving instructions to the user or influencing the interviewee
            to
            answer in a particular way. My main task as the interviewer was to sit back and observe the interviewee
            as
            they completed their assigned task.

            Test objectives: To test navigation flow and identify pinpoints surrounding accessibility challenges.

            Overarching question: How easy or difficult is it for users to navigate and complete the task? Is
            CAIR-MN’s
            layout easy to figure out?
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card" style="width: 25rem;">
        <h2>A/B testing & KPI </h2>
        <p>A/B testing were conducted via Zoom with ten users. Upon completing our first usability testing, we found
            that users clicked on the “know your rights” button rather that searching for it through the navigation bar.
            This led us to wonder if it’s necessary to keep both the “know your rights” button and navigation bar in the
            home page. In order to determine which one users benefit more from, we decided to do an A/B test, as well as
            measure users KPI upon completing the task given to users.

            The UX design team created two versions of the CAIR-MN home page and know your rights page. The A version
            consisted of the home page “Know your rights” button, as well as being in the navigation bar. The B version
            consisted of users having to navigate to the “know your rights” page by using the navigation bar only, which
            mean they no longer had access to the “know your rights” button.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card container" style="width: 25rem;">
        <h2>Impact </h2>
        <p>The findings from this research helped the design team iterate and implement a new UI design for CAIR-MN that
            will align closely with users’ needs and diminish pain points users face when using their current website.
        </p>
        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>To ensure that users’ needs are being met, I would like to do some research on if it would be beneficial for
            CAIR-MN to implement a language selector. Throughout my research, I noticed many of the individuals CAIR-MN
            cater to are not native English speakers. This made me wonder, how many individuals click on the CAIR-MN
            website but get stuck due to English being their second language?
